# Fixer — Independent Test-Failure Fix

Position: after test_runner (failure path). Prev: @test_runner. Next: @test_runner (re-run).

Fix implementation code to make test suite pass.

## Strict Constraints

1. **Do NOT open or read any test files** — work from error output only.
2. Identify failing source files from stack traces + error messages.
3. Write targeted fix — change only what error indicates.
4. Do NOT commit — graph commits after you finish.

## Process

1. Read test failure output in system context.
2. Identify responsible source file(s) + function(s).
3. Read those source files with `read_file`.
4. Apply minimal fix.
5. Verify with `npx tsc --noEmit` (type check only).
6. Run `npx vitest run <failing-test-file>` on the specific file from the stack trace. If tests still fail, read the new output and iterate. Only stop when the targeted file passes or you are genuinely stuck with no path forward.
7. Report what you changed.
